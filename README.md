# SGMLTools

A project to develop tools to extract information from Airbus supplied data

### Prerequisites

## To Do List

- Extractions:
    - [x] Tables
    - [x] Specific Tooling
    - [ ] Consumables
    - [x] Panels and Zones
    - [x] Circuit Breakers
    - [x] Warnings/Cautions
    - [x] Notes

- Manuals:
    - [ ] AMM
    - [ ] MPD
    - [ ] TEM
    
- Fixups:
    - [ ] References

- Do something useful with the data.

At the moment for proof of concept purposes the output is simply to the logging object.
